== IDEs

=== Visual studio at B<>COM

Several versions of Visual Studio C++ can be used at b<>com.
Visual c++ iso can be downloaded from here:

 \\filer.b-com.local\share\common\DIT\Software\DevTools\IDE\VisualStudio

*Commercial purposes:*

* Visual Studio Professional 2013
**  about 20 licenses are available at b<>com
* Visual Studio Professional 2015
** 5 licenses are available at b<>com


*For opensource and education purposes,*

* Visual Studio Community 2015

NOTE: per user Visual C++ pro 2015 licenses will be buyed
if necessary (300€ / each)


=== QT Creator + Microsoft Visual C++ Build tools

QT Creator is a cross platform IDE allowing the development
of opensource or commercial products for linux, windows, android, ios, etc.

This section describes several steps aiming at installing:

. C++ / C compiler (Visual C++ 2015 build tools, by Microsoft)
. Native (microsoft) standalone debugger
. QT creator
. cmake


==== Installing Visual C++ 2015 Build tools

* First download visualcppbuildtools_full.exe, at the following link:

https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/f/7/5f7acaeb-8363-451f-9425-68a90f98b238/visualcppbuildtools_full.exe?fixForIE=.exe

Launch visualcppbuildtools_full.exe, and choose default installation:

---

* When installation is complete, test that you have a functional C++ compiler as follows:
** In Windows Start Menu, look for "All Programs - Visual C++ Build Tools - Windows Desktop Command Prompts" and launch:

 Visual C++ 2015 x64 Native Build Tools Command Prompt

** A console windows will open, enter the following commands:

  > cd c:\Users\%USERNAME%
  > mkdir testC++
  > cd "testC++"

image::task-7737-IDE-licenses\task-7737-IDE-licenses-dd389.png[]

** in a text editor, create a new file, enter the following C++ code,  name it "helloWorld.cpp" and save in
"C:\Users\[your username]\test++"" folder as follows:

  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  void main() {
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
  }

image::task-7737-IDE-licenses\task-7737-IDE-licenses-6bb0e.png[]

** back to your console window, compile helloWorld.cpp:

  cl helloWorld.cpp

image::task-7737-IDE-licenses\task-7737-IDE-licenses-59abd.png[]

** run the hello world executable:

image::task-7737-IDE-licenses\task-7737-IDE-licenses-c7652.png[]


Voilà, you have a functional C/C++ compiler!
Next step, debugging tools.

==== Debugging tools

==== cmake

==== QT creator


==== installing QT Creator on Windows

We can avoid installing the whole Visual Studio IDE, as we only need the compiler.
The following procedure is proposed:

* installation of Visual Studio C++ Build Tools 2015:
** https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/f/7/5f7acaeb-8363-451f-9425-68a90f98b238/visualcppbuildtools_full.exe?fixForIE=.exe
** this will install the C/C++ compilers for 32 and 64 bit-architecture

* installation of QT, from QT online installer
** http://download.qt.io/official_releases/online_installers/qt-unified-windows-x86-online.exe
** during installation choose a minimal QT 5.8.0 with msvc2015 64bits, and QT Tools->QT creator only

// NOTE: @azdine: add a screenshot here !

* installation of debuggers (cdb)

** go to:

 https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit

** on this page search and click on  "Get Debugging Tools for Windows (WinDbg) (from the SDK)" and launch "SDKSETUP.exe"

** during installation: only select debugger tools

WARNING: on windows 7, compiling a debug version will cause an issue (ucrtbased.dll is missing)
and debugging will not work

 => copy the missing lib from C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x64\ucrt to c:\windows\system32

==== installing QT Creator on Ubuntu

Download qt installer for Linux 64 bits here:

== Build management

=== CMAKE

A complete cmake tutorial is available here:

 git clone ssh://gitolite@forge.b-com.com/atadrist-sandbox/cmake-tuto.git

This tutorial demonstrates the following cmake capabilities:

. generation of a binary and a library
. introspection features (tests if some functions are provided by local system)
. macro function in a CMakeLists.txt
. ctest features (unitary tests)
. cpack features (packaging functionalities)

NOTE: CMakeLists.txt can be directly opened with QT Creator

NOTE: a visual studio project can also be generated from CMakeLists.txt, with -G option (for instance : cmake -G " Visual Studio 14 2015 [Win64]" CMakeLists.txt)


=== QMAKE

Two qmake projects are available here:

 git clone ssh://gitolite@forge.b-com.com/atadrist-sandbox/libtest.git

which demonstrates a cross platform qmake project that generates a shared library for windows or unix.


 git clone ssh://gitolite@forge.b-com.com/atadrist-sandbox/uselib.git

which demonstrates a cross platform application that uses a shared library (linked at compilation) on windows or unix.

NOTE: a Visual studio project may be generated from .pro (qmake) files with the following commands:

 qmake.exe -t vclib (in case of a library)
 qmake.exe -t vcapp (in case of an applicationinclude::.bundle\gems\ruby\2.3.0\gems\asciidoctor-revealjs-1.0.2\templates\slim\document.html.slim[])
